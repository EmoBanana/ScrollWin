## The Problem Scroll&Win Solves

### 1. Lack of Trust in Centralized Prediction Markets
Traditional prediction markets rely on centralized entities, which can manipulate outcomes, restrict participation, or introduce biases. Scroll&Win addresses this issue by decentralizing market control using blockchain technology and smart contracts. Every transaction and market resolution is transparent, providing a tamper-proof betting experience.

### 2. Censorship of Market Proposals
In centralized platforms, market proposals can be censored or restricted based on sensitive topics. Scroll&Win eliminates this risk by providing a censorship-resistant platform, allowing users to freely create and participate in prediction markets without arbitrary restrictions, as long as they comply with decentralized rules enforced by smart contracts.

### 3. Delays in Payouts
Centralized prediction markets often face delays in payouts due to slow banking transactions. Scroll&Win automates the payout process using smart contracts, ensuring that winnings are distributed instantly after a market resolves — no middlemen or delays involved.
